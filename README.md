### Hey, I'm Jonathan :wave:

I'm a backend developer. I'm into fiction, databases and niche wikipedia pages.

For fans of bullet points:
- Ruby & Rails / Postgres / JS
- excellent question asker and PR reviewer
- independent learner (proudly self-taught :muscle:)
- crystal clear communicator :gem:
- (arguably) fun to work with
